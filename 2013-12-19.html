<div class="slide" id="intro">
	<p class="block-text" id="blurb">Hello and welcome! In this experiment you will see a sequence of <span id="numquestions"></span> animations. 
	Each animation will include three objects: a circle, a square, and a triangle. One of these objects will change its form, either independently
	or under the influence of another object. For example, you may see an animation like the following:</p>
	<br>
	<button type="button" id = "example" onclick="this.blur(); experiment.example();">Play Animation</button>
	
	<div class='canvas' id='example_canvas'></div>
	<br>
	<p class="block-text" id="blurb">After each animation ends, a sentence will appear below the animation. 
	Each of these sentences will contain a novel verb. <b>The novel verb in each sentence refers to the 
	change in form that took place in one of the objects in the animation.</b> We want you to judge how 
	acceptable this sentence is as a description of what you saw in the animation. Choose your answer on  
	a 7-point scale from "Completely Unacceptable" to "Completely Acceptable." Here is an example question:</p>
	<div class='responseobjects' id = "responses">
<br>
<p class="block-text" id="blurb">Please indicate how acceptable you find the following sentence as a description of the scene:</p>
<br>
<p class="qtxt"><span id="example_questiontxt"></span></p>
<br>
<br>
<form id='form'>
<div class='example_response' id='example_ratings'>
      <tr>Completely Unacceptable &nbsp; &nbsp;
	<input class='example_rating' name='example_rating' type='radio' id='v1'
	value='1' />
	<input class='example_rating' name='example_rating' type='radio' id='v2'
	value='2' />
	<input class='example_rating' name='example_rating' type='radio' id='v3'

	<input class='example_rating' name='example_rating' type='radio' id='v4'
	value='4' />
	<input class='example_rating' name='example_rating' type='radio' id='v5'

</div>
<br>	
	<p class="block-text" id="blurb">After giving your judgment, you will be able to move on to the next animation. 
	Each new animation will begin playing after 2 to 3 seconds. Please wait and pay careful attention to the animation.</p>
